## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnCalc` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a

   variable.)
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edgeLength 2 ^ *`

   Answer: TODO

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: TODO
